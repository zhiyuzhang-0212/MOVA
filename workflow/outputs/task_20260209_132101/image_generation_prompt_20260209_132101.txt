A medium shot from eye-level angle, capturing a plump, vibrant orange tabby cat mid-play on a sunlit wooden floor. The cat is crouched low with front paws extended, tail flicking upward in excitement, ears perked forward, and bright green eyes locked intently on a bright cobalt-blue yarn ball just inches away—its fur slightly ruffled, one paw gently nudging the ball as it begins to roll. Soft natural light streams in from a large window off-frame left, casting gentle highlights on the cat’s glossy ginger fur and creating warm, subtle shadows that ground the scene. The background is softly blurred (shallow depth of field) to emphasize focus on the cat and yarn ball, revealing hints of a cozy, minimalist living room: a pale beige rug, a corner of a cream-colored sofa, and soft daylight-diffused curtains. The color palette is warm and inviting—golden-orange tones of the cat contrast vividly with the saturated, matte-finish blue of the yarn ball. The composition follows the rule of thirds, with the cat positioned slightly right of center and the yarn ball near the lower-left intersection point. Crisp, high-resolution, photorealistic style with gentle bokeh, evoking the cheerful, playful mood of a premium pet lifestyle video. No text, logos, or UI elements.
