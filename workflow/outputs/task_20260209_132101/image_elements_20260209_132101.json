  "visual_description": "**1. VISUAL STYLE**  \n- Art style: High-resolution photography, photorealistic.  \n- Color palette: Warm tones dominate—amber/orange fur, light wood flooring, beige furniture; vibrant saturated blue yarn contrasts sharply. Natural lighting enhances warmth.  \n- Overall atmosphere: Calm, domestic, sunlit interior scene; no visible emotional cues beyond the cat’s focused posture.  \n- Image quality: Sharp detail on the cat and yarn; smooth textures on fur, wood grain, and fabric; high clarity with subtle lens flare from window light.\n\n**2. CAMERA/CINEMATOGRAPHY INFORMATION**  \n- Shot size: Medium shot (captures cat fully, plus surrounding floor and partial background).  \n- Camera angle: Slightly low angle, near floor level, eye-level with the cat’s body.  \n- Composition: Cat positioned left of center, yarn in lower right third; rule of thirds loosely applied; diagonal line formed by cat’s extended paw and tail.  \n- Depth of field: Shallow—cat and yarn in sharp focus; background (sofa, plant, window frame) softly blurred with bokeh.  \n- Camera position: Front-three-quarter view of the cat, slightly from its right side.\n\n**3. VISUAL ELEMENTS**  \n- Characters/People: One orange tabby cat with distinct dark stripes, green eyes, upright ears, and raised tail; crouched low, left front paw extended toward yarn, right front paw planted, hind legs braced.  \n- Objects/Props: A tightly wound spherical ball of bright blue yarn on light hardwood floor; visible loose strand trailing from yarn to cat’s paw.  \n- Scene/Environment: Indoor living space; light-colored hardwood floor, large multi-pane window on left letting in bright daylight, out-of-focus beige sofa with wooden legs on right, blurred potted plant in background center.  \n- Lighting: Strong directional natural light from left (window), casting soft shadows to right of cat and yarn; highlights on cat’s fur and floor surface.  \n- Spatial Relationships: Cat is left of yarn, facing right; yarn sits ~15 cm ahead of cat’s extended paw; window is behind and to cat’s left; sofa is behind and to cat’s right.\n\n**4. TEXT/OCR RECOGNITION**  \n- No readable text, labels, signs, watermarks, UI elements, or subtitles are visible in the image.",
